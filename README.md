# MTA Bus ACE Enforcement Analysis

This project analyzes the impact of MTA Automated Camera Enforcement (ACE) on bus speeds, violations, and rider experience using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. We leveraged data analysis and visualization libraries such as **pandas**, **numpy**, and **matplotlib** (including `pyplot`, `numpy`, and `Patch` for custom plotting) to process and visualize datasets including bus route segment speeds (2023â€“2024 and 2025) and ACE violation records. 

The analysis examined:
- Speed changes on CUNY-heavy routes
- High-violation hotspots and their effect on bus slowdowns
- Comparison of ACE-enforced versus non-enforced routes
- Alignment between violations and speed gains
- Equity of enforcement benefits across NYC boroughs

Visualizations and tables were used throughout to summarize insights and support recommendations for targeted enforcement and equitable rider improvements.
